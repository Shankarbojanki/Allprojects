Object and class

Object and Class Example: main within the class

//Java Program to illustrate how to define a class and fields  
//Defining a Student class.  
class Student{  
 //defining fields  
 int id;//field or data member or instance variable  
 String name;  
 //creating main method inside the Student class  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  //Creating an object or instance  
  Student s1=new Student();//creating an object of Student  
  //Printing values of the object  
  System.out.println(s1.id);//accessing member through reference variable  
  System.out.println(s1.name);  
 }  
}  


Object and Class Example: main outside the class

//Java Program to demonstrate having the main method in   
//another class  
//Creating Student class.  
class Student{  
 int id;  
 String name;  
}  
//Creating another class TestStudent1 which contains the main method  
class TestStudent1{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  Student s1=new Student();  
  System.out.println(s1.id);  
  System.out.println(s1.name);  
 }  
}
